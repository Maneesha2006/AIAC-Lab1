The sun slips low, a golden thread,
Weaving light where day has fled.
Soft winds whisper through the trees,
Carrying secrets on the breeze.

Shadows stretch across the land,
Time slips through an open hand.
Hope still lingers in the sky,
Even as the stars draw nigh.
In the hush, the heart can hearâ€”
Night brings dreams that draw us near.
